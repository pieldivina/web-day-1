        <h3>What is the internet?</h3>
            <p>The internet is a vast network of interconnected computers that 
            communicate using standardized protocols. It allows users to
            access and share information globally.</p>

        <h3>HTML</h3>
            <h4>What is HTML?</h4>
                <p>The first web page was written in HTML (HyperText Markup Language).
                It is the standard markup language used to create web pages. It structures
                content on the web, allowing browsers to display text, images, 
                and other elements.</p>

            <h4>How to use HTML?</h4>
                <p>HTML uses tags to define elements. Tags are enclosed in angle brackets.
                Elements can include headings, paragraphs, links, images, and lists.</p>
                <p>HTML documents are structured with a basic layout, including a HEAD section
                for metadata and a BODY section for content.</p>
